 ❌ No centralized system for managing services and payments
📌 AutoCare solves this by:
 ✅ Online appointment scheduling – Customers can book service slots
 ✅ Service & pricing management – Shop owners can update their service catalog
 ✅ Customer database – Stores customer details for future reference
 ✅ Secure authentication system – Ensures only authorized users can access data
